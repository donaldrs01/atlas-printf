# Recreating printf()...the long way.

Welcome to the my repository! In here contains a project recreating the printf function without case or switch statements.This project was done trimester 1 at Holberton School Tulsa, and the project was written using the C programming language.


## Project Requirements 
  - Compiler used to test code: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
  - Authorized functions and macros:
    - write (man 2 write)
    - malloc (man 3 malloc)
    - free (man 3 free)
    - va_start (man 3 va_start)
    - va_end (man 3 va_end)
    - va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
    - va_arg (man 3 va_arg)
  - Tasks
    - Task 0: Write a function that produces output according to a format.You need to handle the following conversion specifiers: c, s, %
    - Task 1: Handle the following conversion specifiers: d, i
    - Task 3: Create a man page for your function.
  - Code must use Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
  - You are not allowed to use global variables.
  - No more than 5 functions per file.
  - The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h.
  - All your header files should be include guarded.
  - Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project.
